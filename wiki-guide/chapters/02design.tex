\section{Collaboration with the Creativity/Design Team \index{Design}} \label{sec:2.1}
To create an effective and visually appealing iGEM Wiki, collaboration with the Creativity/Design team is essential.
You do not only want to simply collect information on your wiki, but present it in a coherent, readable and convincing way to both fellow iGEMers and judges.
Consider the following design aspects:

\paragraph{Choosing Colors:} Select a cohesive color palette that reflects your team’s branding.\\
If the team has no prior experience with design, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_psychology}{color psychology}\cite{colorpsychology} or simply color palette choosing tools can be a helpful starting point, especially in small teams with limited resources.
\paragraph{Initial Design Work:} Ideally, start in a design program or layout tool (e.g.\ Figma) to visualize your ideas before implementing them on the Wiki.
Alternatively, vision boards or analogue planning methods such as drawing work as well.
\paragraph{Choosing Illustration Styles:} Decide on illustration styles that align with your overall design and branding.
Consistency in style helps create a unified look across your Wiki, making it more visually appealing and easier for users to navigate. \\

Style considerations can be the software used for illustrations and specific details such as the usage of borders and shadows for in-house designs.

%\paragraph{Importance of Branding:} Establish a strong brand identity through consistent use of colors and design elements.
\paragraph{Logo usage:} There are many possibilities to use your team logo on your wiki.
Both for simple things such as buttons as well as more complex things such as animations, progress bars or a guide through your website.
