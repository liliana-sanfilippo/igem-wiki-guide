\section{Hardware}
The most obvious requirement is a laptop or computer.
In my experience, laptop-tablet 2-in-1 devices can be difficult to work with due to limitations in handling coding tasks.
Additionally, not all laptops can smoothly run the required coding environments.
We have encountered common issues with Windows laptops, particularly around scripts not being allowed to run or installations being blocked.
On personal devices, these problems can usually be fixed (with an internet search), but on university-provided
laptops, users may not have the administrative rights needed to make necessary changes. \\ \newline
I recommend to address these issues on debut, as deferred tasks tend to not get done in iGEM projects and trying to fix
them last minute may lead to delays that are difficult to recover from.
