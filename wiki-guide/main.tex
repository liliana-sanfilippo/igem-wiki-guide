\section{Introduction}
This document serves as a comprehensive guide for creating and managing your project Wiki. It is organized into various sections that cover specific aspects of project management, collaboration, design, documentation, and technical implementation. \\
Throughout this guide, I will assume a successful activation of the team Wiki but will walk the reader through the fundamental aspects of setting up the Wiki, as well as providing a general overview of project documentation. I will emphasize key elements that are essential for the Wiki team, such as effective documentation, clarity, and organizational strategies. The coding section will specifically focus on React applications, explaining the basics and offering guidance on best practices and methods for creating a dynamic and user-friendly interface. \\ \newline
At the end of the guide, there will be an index list to help you easily find specific topics and navigate through the content more efficiently. \\
This guide also serves as documentation to the associated template wiki, which teams are free to use as a starting point. \\ \newline
It is a first version and I will be working on improving it, so any feedback or ideas can be sent to liliana.sanfilippo@uni-bielefeld.de or raised as issues on GitHub. \\ \newline

While updating the guide, some already finished sections will be re-added and the following aspects will be added:
