## Introduction 
This repository contains a React template Wiki and a wiki guide containing guidance for both the template wiki as well as iGEM wikis in general. 

It is aimed at first-time teams with little experience as well as advanced iGEM teams.
The goal is to make it easier to get started with the technical implementation of your wiki without having to compromise on functionality or flexibility. 
The template is currently developed further, including some independent packages.

The aim is better usability and maintainability compared to the example wiki provided by iGEM through additional functions, including components designed to work with the template specifically.
It is a first version and I will be working on improving it, so any feedback or ideas can be sent to me or raised as issues on GitHub. 
Documentation for other tools or packages by myself is not included, but wil be linked.

## The guide
To get to the guide, simply click the link above (Quick links). It awlays contains the newest version, since the document is updated automatically. 

## The template wiki
The template wiki is currently being reworked and transferred here as well as the wiki guide. Technical documentation will be added to the README.
